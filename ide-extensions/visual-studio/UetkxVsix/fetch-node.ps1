# Downloads the pinned Windows x64 Node runtime into .\server\node.exe so the VSIX is fully
# self-contained -- the VS2022 extension launches `server\node.exe server.js` and needs NO Node on the
# user's PATH. Run this after the server bundle has been copied into .\server and before building /
# packaging the VSIX. CI (the publish workflow) runs it too. Idempotent: skips if node.exe is present.
