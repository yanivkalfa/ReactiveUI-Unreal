# Changelog

All notable changes to the **ReactiveUI plugin** (`Plugins/ReactiveUI/`) are documented here,
keep-a-changelog style; versions are the plugin's `VersionName`. This file is mirrored
**byte-identically** into `Plugins/ReactiveUI/CHANGELOG.md` — edit only this root file, then
resync with `cp CHANGELOG.md Plugins/ReactiveUI/CHANGELOG.md` (CI byte-compares them via
`scripts/verify-mirror.mjs`). The IDE extensions are NOT covered here — they use
`ide-extensions/changelog.json` (Lane B; see the release-process skill).

## [0.13.0] — Unreleased

### Added

- **ES combined import forms**: `import Def, { a, b as c } from "./file"` and
  `import Def, * as X from "./file"` — one declaration carrying the default binding plus the
  named/namespace surface, exactly as in ES. Parsed (C++ scanner + the LSP's TS mirror,
  corpus-locked), formatted (one canonical line — an exclusive-branch reprint would have
  silently dropped the named part), lowered (the codegen alias plane, the resolver's
  binding/usage/2326 diagnostics, and the eager-edge cycle analysis treat every part
  independently), colored, and duplicate-checked across all parts
  (`import a, { b as a }` is UETKX2325).

## [0.12.0] — 2026-07-18

ES modules: a `.uetkx` file IS a module. Plain C++-typed declarations replace the wrapper
keywords, the full ES import surface lands, and privacy becomes real at runtime — the family
redesign (locked G-01..G-13), Unreal leg first.

### Added

- **Signature-classified declarations** (the wrapper keywords retire): `export FRuiNode
  Name(T P = D, ...) { … }` is a component (PascalCase enforced), `export <T> UseName(...)` a
  hook (return type leads; `void` explicit), `export <T> Name = init;` a **value export**
  (`export Name = T(...);` inference sugar — the initializer must name its type, else
  `UETKX2322`), any other callable a **util function**. Values emit decl-phase-only
  `inline const`; utils are hook-shaped minus the `Ctx` injection.
- **The full ES import surface**: rename-on-import (`import { A as B }` — every `B` reference
  rewrites to `A` at emit, tags included), namespace imports (`import * as X` — `X::Member`
  quals strip to the real symbols), default imports (`import D from "./x"` binding the
  target's `export default`), deferred `export { a, b };` lists (mixable with inline
  `export`), and `export default X;` (one per file; does NOT name-export X — ES parity).
- **New diagnostics `UETKX2320`–`2327`** (family band): 2320 wrapper-deprecation warn; 2321
  Use-prefixed-but-FRuiNode cross-guard; 2322 failed value-type inference; 2323 export of an
  undeclared name; 2324 duplicate export; 2325 import-alias collision; 2326 default-importing
  a file with no default; 2327 duplicate `export default`.
- **`-run=RUIMigrateEsModules`** — the idempotent, record-driven codemod: tidies preambles,
  exports everything, flips wrappers to plain declarations (param colon-flip from parsed
  records), hoists `module` members to value/util exports (importers' `{ M }` flip to
  `import * as M` with zero body edits), inserts missing imports, and gates on a
  zero-diagnostics compile including zero 2320 outside explicitly-reported skips. The demo
  tree ships fully migrated; the "New Component" template scaffolds the new grammar.
- **HMR blast radius**: recompiling a support file (values/hooks/utils) logs its importers
  (`[RUI] hmr: X is a support file — the rebuild patches its importer(s): …`) from the
  sidecar dependency graph.

### Changed

- **Runtime privacy is real (TD-026 fixed)**: a PRIVATE component's runtime identity is now
  file-qualified (`RuiPriv_<File>::<Name>`) — two files' private same-named components can no
  longer collide last-swap-wins in the HMR registries. Exported components keep their short
  names. Documented consequence: renaming a file remounts its private members (state reset);
  exported members keep identity. CodegenVersion 2→3.
- **Eager-edge staleness widens**: the `UETKX2306` value-cycle check and the aggregator's
  ordering now treat value/util/namespace/default bindings as eager edges (hooks/modules
  already were); component-only imports stay lazy (cycles legal).
- **The legacy wrapper grammar still parses for this one minor** — each `component`/`hook`/
  `module` keyword warns `UETKX2320`; removal comes in a later minor, announced per the
  deprecation policy. The formatter is form-preserving both ways (it never migrates syntax —
  that is the codemod's job).
- **Preview message**: a PRIVATE component now explains "add `export` to preview it" instead
  of the misleading "not compiled yet" (privates never register a factory by design).

### Fixed

- **A ternary's second arm broke alias/private qualification** (`? A::X : B::Y` — the lone
  `:` was mis-read as a `::` scope qual, so the second reference kept its alias and emitted
  broken C++; the same latent bug skipped `RuiPriv_::` qualification after a ternary).
  Region-scanned with the IMPORT-3 rule everywhere (only a real `::` blocks).
- **Local variables shadowing an import alias / private name / exported value are locals now
  (TD-034)**: a new scope tracker (`FUetkxScopedLocals` — brace scopes; params, `Type Name =`,
  `auto`, structured bindings) runs under every rewrite plane and the reference collector, so
  a shadowing local is no longer alias-rewritten, `RuiPriv_::`-qualified, `Ctx`-injected as a
  hook, or false-2305'd — while references BEFORE the shadowing declaration still are. The
  tracker is a pinned heuristic (contract fixture `ShadowedNames.uetkx`); an exotic
  declaration shape it misses keeps the old behavior (documented residual). Its type-ish
  lookbehind applies the ternary lone-`:` rule too — `U = a ? B : B;` no longer mis-reads
  the second arm as a declaration.
- **Usage policing now sees markup expressions (TD-034)**: attr/spread expressions, `@if`
  conditions and bodies, `@for`/`@while` headers and bodies, and `@match` subjects/cases join
  the external-reference walk (text children never scanned). A value/util/hook used ONLY
  inside markup no longer warns `UETKX2304` unused, and using one WITHOUT its import now
  diagnoses `UETKX2305` at edit time instead of failing later in the C++ compile.
  `RUIMigrateEsModules` inherits both through the shared collector. An `@for` loop variable
  named like an exported value stays a local (its header declarations scope into the body).
- **Shadowing holds inside markup expressions too (audit)**: the emitter now consults a
  body-wide in-scope oracle, so a setup local shadowing an import alias or private name keeps
  its own spelling in attr expressions, across value-markup fragmentation, and inside
  directive frames — previously those positions rewrote to the alias TARGET and silently read
  the wrong symbol. The tracker also recognizes range-for variables and lambda parameters
  (both were false-2305/rewrite candidates), a comma no longer keeps the type-ish lookbehind
  (`Func(A, B = 1)` mis-declared `B` as a local), and the reference walks skip markup ranges
  so attribute names like `Value`/`Text` can no longer mint junk locals that masked real
  missing-import errors.

## [0.11.0] — 2026-07-17

Markup everywhere: markup is a first-class EXPRESSION now, legal at every boundary position —
grammar parity with the Godot/Unity siblings' jsx scan, plus the family rules-of-hooks.

### Added

- **Markup as a value** (`auto Card = (<VerticalBox>…</VerticalBox>);`, bare
  `FRuiNode Chip = <TextBlock … />;`, call arguments, ternary branches, short-circuit
  `cond && <Chip/>`): detected by the family's position-gated jsx scan (a `<` begins markup
  only after a boundary token — assignment, `(`, `[`, `,`, `?`, ternary `:`, `&&`, `||`,
  `return`, `else` — so comparisons like `a < b` can never match) and lowered in place to a
  self-contained `FRuiNode` expression. `{ X }` children already spliced node values, so the
  runtime is untouched; a value renders anywhere, including spliced more than once.
- **Rules of hooks — `UETKX0013`/`0014`/`0015`/`0016`** (the family's Unity/Godot numbers):
  hooks must run unconditionally at the top level of the component body. A `Use*` call under
  an `if`/`else` (0013), a loop (0014), a `switch`/`@match` branch (0015), or inside a
  lambda/event attribute (0016) — and anywhere inside markup (attr/child expressions,
  directive bodies, by their enclosing kind) — is now a compile error instead of a
  hook-order landmine.
- **AcceptanceLab §10** — the markup-as-value section: `FRuiNode` locals (both spellings),
  the same value spliced twice, short-circuit + ternary value markup inline.
- **Editor menu**: ReactiveUetkx → **Message Log** — one-click access to the ReactiveUI
  compile-error page (the clickable jump-to-file rows), which the engine otherwise parks
  under Window's LOG section.

### Changed

- **`UETKX0114` narrowed**: markup-as-value is no longer an error — what remains illegal is
  the paren-less statement-level markup return (`return <Tag/>;` → "a markup return must be
  parenthesized — write `return ( <...> );`").
- **Hook signatures ignore markup text** (HMR protection): editing a markup value or an
  early-return window can never perturb the hook signature and spuriously reset live state.
  This also corrects a latent wart — components with statement-level early returns get a
  ONE-TIME signature change at upgrade (one HMR state reset on the first swap).

### Fixed

- **Unreachable-code detection (`UETKX0107`) no longer lexes markup as C++**: markup ranges
  are skipped whole, so a `;`, apostrophe, or bracket inside markup text can no longer
  corrupt the walk.

## [0.10.0] — 2026-07-16

Include retirement: `.uetkx` preambles are imports-only now (INCLUDE_RETIREMENT_PLAN.md) —
family convergence with Unity's `import "@Namespace"` shape, ported with a per-leg payload.

### Added

- **Auto-included prelude**: every generated file now carries the library's own headers
  automatically (`RuiContext.h`, `RuiCoreElements.h`, `RuiRouter.h`, the UMG/CommonUI/MVVM
  interop headers when that plugin is linked, `UObject/StrongObjectPtr.h`, `Engine/World.h`,
  and more — `FUetkxFileScan::AutoIncludedHeaders()`), `__has_include`-guarded so a module that
  depends only on `ReactiveUICore`+`ReactiveUISlate` still compiles.
- **`import "@Header.h"`** — a nameless host-include import form (family shape, ported from
  Unity's `import "@Namespace"`; our payload is a header path): compiles to
  `#include "Header.h"` verbatim. Nameless by design — the C++ compiler resolves the header's
  symbols, so there is nothing for the toolchain to name-check.
- **`UETKX2317`** (hint): a `#include` or `import "@X.h"` naming a header already on the
  auto-included list is flagged as redundant (the family's redundant-using hint, per-leg
  number). `UETKX2316` reserved (post-v1) — header-existence checking would need visibility
  into UBT include paths this compiler doesn't have.
- **`RUIMigrateImports -tidy`** (Unity's `--tidy` analogue): an idempotent, re-runnable codemod
  pass that rewrites every preamble to imports-only — an auto-included header is deleted
  outright, a surviving raw `#include` converts to `import "@Header.h"`. Surgical: only a
  construct alone on its own physical line is touched, so a comment anywhere in the preamble is
  never at risk.
- Syntax highlighting + LSP support for the new form: completion offers a discoverable
  `import "@"` snippet in the preamble; import intelligence (resolution, go-to-def) correctly
  treats a host include as nameless.

### Changed

- The demo gallery's preambles are migrated imports-only via `-tidy` (e.g. `MvvmDemo.uetkx`
  drops all three of its includes entirely; `DoomHUD.uetkx`'s user header becomes
  `import "@Doom/DoomTypes.h"`). Raw `#include` lines still parse and compile — nothing is
  removed, only superseded as the recommended spelling.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-07-16

Widget-completion wave G: grammar alignment — early returns and short-circuit rendering land;
**the widget-completion plan is fully DONE** (all waves 0–4 + G).

### Added

- **Early component-level returns** (family Phase-C parity, the Unity verbatim-emit model):
  guard clauses `if (x) { return ( <A/> ); }` now work anywhere in a component body — the
  body's C++ splices verbatim and every markup return lowers in place. The *final* markup
  return must be top-level (new diagnostic `UETKX3007`). Single-return bodies compile
  byte-identically to before.
- **Short-circuit rendering** (the Unity Phase-1.5 port): `{ cond && <X/> }` renders the
  element only when the condition holds; `{ cond || <X/> }` only when it does not —
  desugared to ternaries with an empty-fragment arm. **`UETKX3002` retired.**
- Contract corpus: `MultiReturn`/`ShortCircuit`/`NestedFinalReturn` goldens + 4 fileScan
  corpus cases in BOTH implementations (C++ compiler and TS language server, byte-identical
  collector port); a compiled `GrammarProof` markup file is mounted end-to-end by the new
  `ReactiveUI.Uetkx.WaveG` suite (battery 127 tests).

## [0.8.0] — 2026-07-16

Widget-completion wave 4: the hierarchical item-model view closes TD-022 — **every widget
in the completion plan is now implemented** (63 markup tags; 65+ wrapped widgets).

### Added

- **`TreeView`** (C++-first, like `ListView` — render closures are not markup-expressible):
  virtualized `STreeView` with per-row reconciler sub-roots, a `GetChildren` child accessor
  (`RUI::Slate::MakeChildAccessor`), **controlled expansion** (`ExpandedItems` diffs onto the
  widget; user toggles report via `OnExpansionChanged`), `SelectionMode`/`OnSelectionChanged`,
  and headless row generation for tests.
- **`HeaderRow` columns (P5c)**: a construct-only `Columns` list (`FRuiHeaderColumn` —
  id/label/fill-width) builds the tree's `SHeaderRow`; a `Columns` change rebuilds the header.
- **`VectorInputBox` / `RotatorInputBox`**: controlled X/Y/Z and Roll/Pitch/Yaw with
  per-component commit events.
- **`Splitter2x2`** (D-W4; 63 markup tags total): four resizable quadrants — children route
  by `Slot.Role` (`topLeft`/`bottomLeft`/`topRight`/`bottomRight`), live `Percentages`.
- `ReactiveUI.Widgets.Batch3c` suite: mounts all 12 wave-3/4 protocol widgets, pins their
  Slate types, and asserts the anchor + fraction slot models end-to-end (battery 126 tests).

### Fixed

- `ConstraintCanvas` slot application order: `SetZOrder` on a not-yet-committed scoped slot
  tripped an engine ensure — children now attach first, then slot props apply through the
  live slot.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-07-16

Widget-completion wave 3: the protocol widgets — popups, toasts, anchors, splitters — and
the first engine-version-gated widget.

### Added

- **10 new widgets** (60 markup tags total): `ConstraintCanvas` (P5a anchor slot model —
  `Slot.Anchors/Offset/Alignment/AutoSize/ZOrder`, all live), `Splitter` (P5b fraction
  slots — `Slot.SizeRule/SizeValue/MinSize/Resizable` + `OnSplitterFinishedResizing`),
  `MenuAnchor` (P3, THE popup primitive: anchor child + `Slot.Role="menu"` popup content;
  controlled `bIsOpen`), `NotificationList` (P4 toast mount +
  `RUI::Slate::PushNotification` command), `NumericDropDown`, `BreadcrumbTrail`
  (declarative crumbs), `LinkedBox` (uniform-size sibling groups by `GroupKey`),
  `WindowTitleBarArea`, `VirtualJoystick`, and `SearchableComboBox` — **the first
  `sinceUE: 5.7` widget** (compiled out on 5.6; the schema carries the annotation).
- **16 slot keys** (anchor + splitter + role families) with `RUI::Slot()` builder parity
  (gate-enforced).

## [0.6.0] — 2026-07-16

Widget-completion wave 2: twelve interactive composites, the imperative-handle rails, and
the TD-012 runtime-setter sweep.

### Added

- **12 new widgets** (50 markup tags total): `EditableText`, `InlineEditableTextBlock`,
  `VirtualKeyboardEntry`, `ColorWheel`, `ColorSpectrum`, `ColorGradingWheel` (the LIVE
  AdvancedWidgets one — new module dependency; the Slate twin is deprecated 5.5),
  `InputKeySelector`, `VolumeControl`, `RadialBox`, `TextScroller`, `LayeredImage`,
  `ExpandableButton` (three role slots via `slot.role`). Controlled-color and
  attribute-only surfaces ride the reconstruct mask; text edits follow the D-16 caret rule.
- **`UseImperativeHandle` ref-publishing overload** (P2): a child publishes a handle object
  into a parent-owned ref box, rebuilt on deps change and CLEARED on unmount; plus
  `RUI::Slate::WidgetFromHandle<T>()` — the typed escape hatch for ScrollToEnd-class
  imperative calls on any captured `Ref`.
- **TD-012 sweep**: Slider `Orientation/bLocked/bIndentHandle/SliderBarColor/
  SliderHandleColor`; ScrollBox `bAllowOverscroll/bAnimateWheelScrolling/
  WheelScrollMultiplier`; TextBlock style keys `LineHeightPercentage` + `OverflowPolicy`
  (16 style keys total); proxy payload handlers for bool/color/name events.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-07-16

Widget-completion wave 1 (the road to 1.0 = ALL official widgets —
`plans/WIDGET_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`): eight new wrapped widgets, the universal tooltip, and two
new anti-drift gates.

### Added

- **8 new widgets** (38 markup tags total): `ColorBlock`, `SimpleGradient`, `ComplexGradient`,
  `Hyperlink` (with `OnNavigate`), `EnableBox`, `ScissorRectBox`, `BackgroundBlur`
  (live `BlurStrength`/`BlurRadius`), `InvalidationPanel` (opt-in paint cache via `bCanCache`).
  The color/gradient/hyperlink leaves are the first widgets whose ENTIRE prop surface is
  construct-only — any prop change replaces the widget in place through the reconstruct-mask
  machinery (cheap leaves; no state to lose).
- **Universal `ToolTipText` style key** — a tooltip on ANY element (the family contract: a
  prop, never a wrapper widget), via `SWidget::SetToolTipText`; removal resets to no tooltip.
  14 style keys total.
- **`RUI::Slot()` gains `ZOrder`/`Position`/`Size`**; `RUI::Style()` gains `Clipping`/
  `ToolTipText` — and a new CI gate (`scripts/check-style-builders.mjs`) fails the build if a
  schema style/slot key ever lacks a builder method again (found 3 missing methods on its
  first run).
- **Button `bIsFocusable`** (construct-only; reconstruct-masked) and **ProgressBar
  `BarFillType`** (live; loyal lowerCamel enum names) — TD-012 riders.
- **`ReactiveUI.Contract.AdapterMasks`** — a registry-wide meta-gate: every adapter declaring
  a reconstruct mask must implement a side-effect-free, Has-gated `ConstructOnlyChanged`
  (caught one violating test fixture on its first run). Powered by a new public
  `RUI::Slate::ForEachAdapter` enumeration seam.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-16

### Added

- **Localization** — the last v1-gate production gap closes. Markup text (emitted as
  self-namespaced `NSLOCTEXT` since the first compiler release) now has a verified gather
  pipeline: add `*.inl` to a localization target's `GatherTextFromSource` masks (the demo
  project ships a complete reference target, `Config/Localization/RuiDemo_Gather.ini`) and
  the Localization Dashboard sees markup text like any C++. A culture switch re-renders every
  mounted root (`RuiCultureSync` subscribes the reconciler to the engine's text-revision
  event), healing values components baked under the previous culture. New suite:
  `ReactiveUI.Loc` (mechanism, live culture switch, gather-manifest tripwire).
- **`URuiHostWidget` designer props & viewmodel channel** — `InitialProps` (name → string map)
  and `ViewModel` (any FieldNotify object) are designer/Blueprint-editable and publish into the
  hosted tree as context; components read them with `RUI::Umg::UseHostProp` /
  `UseHostViewModel` (the viewmodel feeds `UseField` directly). `SynchronizeProperties`
  forwards edits live — no remount, hook state preserved. Suite: `ReactiveUI.Umg.HostProps`.
- **CommonUI desired focus** — `RUI::CommonUI::UseDesiredFocus` lets the hosted tree designate
  its initial gamepad-focus widget (pair with `RUI::Slate::UseFocus`); `URuiActivatableScreen`
  now honors CommonUI's `GetDesiredFocusTarget()` contract by returning itself and forwarding
  the arriving focus to the designated widget. Suite: `ReactiveUI.CommonUI.DesiredFocus`.
- **Embedded-C++ completion in the IDE extensions** (ships as vscode/vs2022 0.2.0): completion
  inside `setup`/`hook`/`module` bodies now forwards to clangd over the virtual document —
  hover, definition, and completion are all wired; markup-only remains the no-clangd baseline.
- **Router gallery demo** — the docs' router samples, live: an in-memory two-route screen
  (`/` + `/users/:id`) with `UseNavigate`/`UseParams`, authored in `.uetkx` with the route
  table in the setup section and the Router as an expression child (gallery: 17 screens).
- **`Ref={ expr }` markup attribute** — the universal reserved prop joins `key` and `classes`:
  capture a mounted widget's host handle straight from markup (React ref lifecycle — called on
  attach, cleared on detach). Powers pure-markup portal targeting and focus designation
  (`<Button Ref={ Focus.Ref } …>`); expr-only (a string form is diagnosed). Pinned by the
  `RefCapture` contract fixture and live in the Acceptance Lab's §9.
- **`RUI::Umg::UseOwnedViewModel<T>`** — create-and-own a viewmodel for the component's
  lifetime (constructed on first render, GC-rooted in a hook slot, released on unmount) — the
  `UseMemo` + `TStrongObjectPtr` pattern, packaged. Suite: `ReactiveUI.Mvvm.OwnedViewModel`.
- **`RUI::Umg::MarshalToProperty` / `MarshalFromProperty`** — the FRuiValue ↔ reflected-
  UPROPERTY conversion table, promoted from the prop-map bridge's internals to a public,
  shared helper (bool, int32/64, float/double, FString, FText, FName; kind mismatches skip,
  never mangle). The prop-map now routes through it. Suite: `ReactiveUI.Umg.Marshal`.
- **Generated per-hook reference docs** — every hook now has its own reference page (23 core +
  17 router), generated from a header-authored catalog the docs-drift gate compares against
  the code registries — the docs can never claim hooks the code doesn't have.
- **`Canvas` widget** — absolute placement over `SCanvas`: children position/size themselves
  via `Slot.Position`/`Slot.Size` (expr or "x,y" literals); paint order = child order; a
  slot-prop update mutates the LIVE slot in place, so per-frame quad movement costs no slot
  churn. Built as the Doom demo's framebuffer container. Suite: `ReactiveUI.Widgets.Canvas`.
- **`<Image Image={ Brush } />`** — the asset-brush prop is now a markup attribute (and the
  props field is renamed `Brush` → `Image`, the loyal Unreal name — D-33; pre-1.0 rename).
- **`Clipping` style key** (universal) — `SWidget::SetClipping` with the loyal
  `EWidgetClipping` names (`clipToBounds` etc.; removal resets to `inherit`). Slate never
  clips children to bounds by default — absolute-placed content (Canvas framebuffers)
  needs this. 13 style keys total.
- **`ScaleBox` `HAlign`/`VAlign`** — place the scaled content inside the box (live
  `SScaleBox` setters; default center|center). Lets fixed-resolution content pin to an
  edge while scaling to fit.
- **The Doom demo** — the family's marquee stress showcase, ported third: a fully playable
  software-raycast FPS whose ENTIRE framebuffer is the widget tree — every wall strip, floor/
  ceiling band, sprite, and tracer is a real keyed `<Image>` diffed per tick (~7k LOC; six
  levels; 100% procedural textures, zero assets). Gallery: 18 screens. Determinism suite
  `ReactiveUI.Doom` (182 checks, ported from the family); `ReactiveUI.Bench.Doom` measures
  the WHOLE frame — sim + geometry + reconcile + Slate apply — at **~197 µs median**.

### Fixed

- `UseStableFunc`/`UseStableAction` were missing from the markup compiler's built-in hook
  table — calling them from `.uetkx` emitted uncompilable code. Added in both
  implementations (C++ scanner + TS language-server mirror); schema re-exported (22 hooks).
- The `ColorAndOpacity` style key was silently dropped on `Image` and `Separator` — markup
  routes it through the style dict (like TextBlock's), but only the C++ typed-props path had
  a handler, so markup tints never reached the widget (the Doom viewport rendered as a solid
  white sheet: its alpha-0 full-screen flash quads painted opaque). Both adapters now handle
  the style key, with removal-reset to opaque white. Suites: `ReactiveUI.Style.WidgetColorKeys`
  (apply/update/reset on both widgets) + `ReactiveUI.Doom.MountedFrame` (the mounted game
  screen's flash quads are asserted transparent).

## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-14

### Added

- **Unreal Engine 5.8 support** — the full 103-test battery is green on 5.6, 5.7, and 5.8.
  The 5.6→5.8 API diff found NO removals: +3 Slate widgets (SSearchableComboBox recorded as
  a wrap candidate; two editor docking widgets out of scope) and additive-only FArguments
  surface across 26 widgets (plans/WIDGET_INVENTORY.md).

### Fixed

- UE 5.8 compat: FJsonObject::Values' key type changed (FString → UE::FSharedString) — the
  .uetkx sidecar reader now iterates keys engine-agnostically; the .uetkx watcher's ticker
  delay uses the API's float type.
- The engine-api-diff tool hard-fails when an engine install is partial (a scan finding
  fewer than 50 widgets aborts instead of emitting a wrong diff).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-14

### Added

- **Unreal Engine 5.7 support** — the full 103-test battery is green on 5.6 AND 5.7. The
  5.6→5.7 API diff (scripts/engine-api-diff.ps1) found zero added/removed widgets and only
  additive FArguments surface (recorded in plans/WIDGET_INVENTORY.md as v1.x candidates).
  The dev .uplugin no longer pins EngineVersion — the pin is a hard per-version compat gate
  (5.7 silently skipped loading the whole plugin in headless runs); per-engine packages
  stamp it at release. DocsURL now points at the docs site.

### Fixed

- UE 5.7 deprecation sweep: FReferenceCollector::AddReferencedObject now takes TObjectPtr
  (the raw-pointer overload is unsafe under incremental GC and removed next release); the
  deprecated FieldNotification include path replaced; a C5038 initializer-order warning in
  TRuiProvidedValue silenced at the source.

- **Portal content no longer leaks on unmount** — deleting a subtree containing a portal (or
  unmounting a whole root) now explicitly removes the portal's children from their target panel;
  previously the release path assumed they lived under the released subtree, leaking them in
  external targets. Found by the feature's first automated test (`ReactiveUI.Core.Portal`).
- **`URuiHostWidget::Remount()` actually remounts** — UMG caches the widget returned by
  `RebuildWidget`, so the old implementation unmounted and never rebuilt. The host now returns a
  stable wrapper and swaps its content in place, making runtime `ComponentName` changes +
  `Remount()` work (covered by `ReactiveUI.Umg.Lifecycle`).
- **Packaged README rewritten** — the README inside the plugin package still described a
  "pre-alpha scaffold — not yet functional"; it now states the beta reality (23 hooks, 35+
  widgets, compiler + drift gate, hot reload, router, stylesheets, Epic interop).
- Softened the unverified accessibility claim in the interop copy to what is verified (Widget
  Reflector + the Slate toolchain see ordinary widgets); the screen-reader path has not been
  exercised yet.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-13

First beta. A complete React-style reactive UI stack for Unreal in pure C++ — function components
return a virtual tree, a fiber reconciler patches real Slate widgets, and state lives in hooks.

### Added

- **Reactive core** — fiber reconciler with keyed diffing/bailout, 23 hooks (`UseState`,
  `UseEffect`, `UseMemo`, `UseRef`, `UseContext`, `UseReducer`, signals, `UseTween`/`UseAnimate`,
  `UseSfx`, `UseFocus`, …), structural error boundaries, and `<Presence>` exit animations. No
  UObject/CoreUObject dependency in the core.
- **Slate host** — 25+ wrapped Slate widgets (boxes, `Button`, `Border`, `Image`, `ScrollBox`,
  text inputs, `CheckBox`, `Slider`, `ProgressBar`, `GridPanel`, virtualized `ListView`/`TileView`,
  plus specials: `ExpandableArea`, `SegmentedControl`, `NumericEntryBox`, `ComboBox`,
  `SuggestionTextBox`) with setter-based styling (a style tweak never rebuilds a widget), typed
  events, drag-and-drop, and keyboard shortcuts.
- **`.uetkx` markup language** — JSX-like, compiles to native C++ (committed `.inl`); `RUICompile`
  commandlet with a content-based drift gate + a golden formatter; **static imports/exports** (strict
  from day one) with the `RUIMigrateImports` codemod.
- **Epic interop** — Slate is the render target; UMG is a two-way door (`URuiHostWidget` /
  `RUI::Umg::UserWidget`); CommonUI hosts our screens (`URuiActivatableScreen` + activation hooks);
  MVVM/FieldNotify viewmodels feed us (`UseField`). A gallery **Interop Showcase** demonstrates all
  four in one screen.
- **HMR** — Unreal Live-Coding-driven hot reload: save a `.uetkx` and the running UI patches with
  state preserved, via the `ReactiveUetkx` editor menu + Hot Reload window (Windows; Live Coding is).
- **`@theme`/`@uss` stylesheets**, the **router** subsystem (17 hooks), a read-only `.uetkx` preview
  tab, and the example gallery (15 screens, including the interop demos).
- **IDE tooling** — a `.uetkx` language server with VS Code and VS2022 clients (completions, hover,
  go-to-definition, import intelligence, formatting, embedded-C++ intelligence).
- **`RUI::Fmt`** — `{}`-placeholder `FText` interpolation for clean bindings.

### Notes

- Beta: API may still shift before 1.0. Cross-platform for build/run; the live-reload DX is Windows.
